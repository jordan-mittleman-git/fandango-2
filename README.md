# fandango-2

Our project is supposed to run as follows, in order to be able to perform our desired functionalities on behalf of the user.

1. Run table-creator.sql to create the necessary tables (run table-dropper.sql to drop all of them)
2. Run sample-db-creator.sql to insert all of our sample data into the tables
3. Run test-sample.sql to create the neccessary procedures (consisting of our Task 5 SQL statements) that perform our application's desired functionalities based on user inputs (run proc-dropper.sql to drop all of them)
4. Run output-sample.sql to produce example outputs that return the desired data based on our made-up 'scenarios' (this runs a simulation of how the user can interact with our application)
